    "## Working with numpy\n",

    "**numpy** is very useful for performing arithmetic and other operations on arrays, vectors and so on. It is an important part of many other packages and, for instance, very useful in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we create a numpy array containing random numbers sampled from a normal distribution. You can change the size, mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate some basic properties of the array, and see how good a job numpy is doing at creating these values. In the code below we calculate **mean** and **standard deviation** iteratively using loops. We first turn the numpy array into a standard list. Experiment with different values of `n`, `mean` and `mu` and convince yourself that the code works.\n"
