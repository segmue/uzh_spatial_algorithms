    "We've now seen some useful methods, which we can subsitute for things we have already implemented. \n",
    "1. If you look at my solution for Practical 5 you will see I use the min method to pull values from lists.\n",
    "2. The Point class below deals with n-dimensional points. It uses iteration to print coordinates to the screen and calculat distance, since we don't know how many dimensions a point has. To calculate distance, we also need to make sure Points have the same number of dimensions\n",
    "3. Two examples show how we can use the datetime package. This is super useful, but be careful about things like time zones and so on, you can easily introduce bugs if you don't (here we do it in a simply way, and don't give a locale (e.g. we assume universal time)"
